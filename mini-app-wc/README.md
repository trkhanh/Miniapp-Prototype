# mini-app-wc

A standalone Web Component demo implementing `dashboard-widget`.

Quick start

1. From the parent directory run:

```bash
cd /home/kao/Workspaces/Miniapp-Prototype/mini-app-wc
npm start
```

2. Open http://localhost:4173 in your browser.

Notes

- This demo uses a tiny static server via `npx http-server` so you don't need to install global tools.
- The component fetches sample user data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.
- You can embed `dashboard-widget` in any shell by loading the `dashboard-widget.js` script.
